# Polymarket Hedged Arbitrage Bot

Fully automated arbitrage bot that captures guaranteed profit from Polymarket's 15-minute Up/Down prediction markets. It buys both YES and NO sides at a combined cost below $1.00, then collects $1.00 when the market resolves — pocketing the spread every 15 minutes.

## How It Makes Money

Every 15 minutes, Polymarket opens binary markets like *"Will BTC go Up or Down?"*. Each market has two tokens — YES and NO — that each resolve to exactly **$1.00** or **$0.00**.

The bot exploits a simple math fact: if you buy YES at $0.47 and NO at $0.47, you spend **$0.94** total. One side always wins and pays **$1.00**. That's **$0.06 profit per share, risk-free**.

```
Buy 5 YES shares @ $0.47  =  $2.35
Buy 5 NO  shares @ $0.47  =  $2.35
                     Total =  $4.70

Market resolves → winning side pays $1.00 × 5 = $5.00
Profit = $5.00 − $4.70 = $0.30 per cycle (6.4% return in 15 min)
```

The bot runs 24/7, executing this strategy every 15 minutes across multiple markets (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP).

## Features

- **Guaranteed Profit** — Both sides of a binary market are purchased; one always wins
- **Sub-second Execution** — 50ms polling loop with fire-and-forget order placement
- **Smart Entry Timing** — Three independent buy triggers (reversal, depth discount, time-based)
- **Adaptive Polling** — Speeds up to 100ms when opportunities are detected, slows to 2s when idle
- **Dynamic Thresholds** — Automatically adjusts second-side entry based on first-side fill price
- **State Persistence** — Resumes mid-hedge after restarts without losing position tracking
- **Risk Guards** — Max cost cap (sumAvg < $0.99), minimum balance check, stale order cleanup
- **Full Logging** — Every trade, price tick, and decision logged to daily rotating files

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ with `ts-node`
- A Polygon wallet funded with USDC
- Polymarket API credentials (auto-generated on first run)

### Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd polymarket-trading-bot
npm install
```

### Configure

Copy the example environment file and set your private key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_polygon_wallet_private_key

TRADE_MARKETS=btc
TRADE_THRESHOLD=0.47
TRADE_SHARES=5
MAX_BUYS_PER_SIDE=1
```

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

The bot will:
1. Generate API credentials (first run only)
2. Approve USDC allowances on Polymarket contracts
3. Wait until your wallet has at least $1 USDC available
4. Begin the arbitrage loop

## Trading Logic

### The 15-Minute Cycle

  │                                              │
  │  Poll midpoint prices every 50ms             │
  │  Wait for YES or NO to drop below $0.47      │
  │                                              │
  │  Token drops → start tracking lowest price   │
  │                                              │
  │  Trigger fires → BUY first side              │
  │  Switch to opposite side                     │
  │  Trigger fires → BUY second side             │
  │                                              │
  │  ✓ Hedge complete — wait for resolution      │
  │                                              │
  :15 ── Market resolves → $1.00 payout ────────
```

### Three Buy Triggers

The bot uses three independent triggers. Whichever fires first executes the buy:

**1. Reversal Detection**
Price dropped to a local minimum, then bounced back up by `REVERSAL_DELTA` ($0.02). This confirms the bottom and buys on the way back up.

**2. Depth Discount**
Price fell more than `DEPTH_BUY_DISCOUNT_PERCENT` (2%) below the tracked low. This catches fast crashes where waiting for a reversal would miss the opportunity.

**3. Time Threshold (second side only)**
After buying one side, if the opposite side stays below its dynamic threshold for 200ms, buy immediately. Prevents missing the second side during slow price movement.

### Second Side Entry

After the first buy, the bot calculates a dynamic threshold for the opposite side:

```
secondSideThreshold = (1 - firstBuyPrice) + dynamicThresholdBoost

Example: Bought YES at $0.47
  → Buy NO when price ≤ 1 - 0.47 + 0.04 = $0.57
```

This ensures the combined cost stays well below $1.00.

### Profit Protection

Before every buy, the bot checks:

```
avgPriceYES + avgPriceNO < TRADE_MAX_SUM_AVG ($0.99)
```

If the combined average would exceed $0.99, the buy is skipped — there's no profit margin left.
